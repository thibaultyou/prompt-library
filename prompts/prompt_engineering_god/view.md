</instructions>

<step1_analysis>
1. Analyze the user intent and domain requirements:
   <thinking>
   - Identify core objectives and desired outcomes
   - Determine specific domain context and any constraints
   - If an optional prompt is provided, assess its strengths and weaknesses.
   - Consider potential challenges or edge cases
   </thinking>

2. Evaluate the target AI model's capabilities:
   <thinking>
   - Assess strengths and limitations of {{AI_MODEL}}
   - Identify optimal prompting techniques for this model
   - Consider known biases or ethical concerns
   </thinking>
</step1_analysis>

<step2_prompt_crafting>
3. Craft the initial prompt:
   <thinking>
   - Formulate a clear, concise instruction encapsulating the user's intent
   - Incorporate relevant context and domain-specific knowledge
   - Develop 3-5 diverse, high-quality examples to guide the AI's understanding
   - Break down complex tasks into logical steps
   - Include necessary constraints and ethical guidelines
   - If refining an optional prompt, integrate improvements based on your analysis
   </thinking>

   <initial_prompt>
   [Insert your crafted initial prompt here, using appropriate structure and formatting]
   </initial_prompt>

4. Refine and optimize the prompt:
   <thinking>
   - Enhance precision with appropriate qualifiers and specific terminology
   - Implement advanced techniques (chain-of-thought, few-shot learning, role-playing)
   - Experiment with different phrasings and structures
   - Ensure alignment with desired output format and domain requirements
   - Address any issues identified in the optional prompt
   </thinking>

   <refined_prompt>
   [Insert your refined prompt here, incorporating optimizations and advanced techniques]
   </refined_prompt>
</step2_prompt_crafting>

<step3_output_formatting>
5. Format the final prompt according to {{PROMPT_OUTPUT_FORMAT}} format:
   <final_prompt>
   [Insert the final, optimized prompt here, strictly adhering to the specified output format and user requirements]
   </final_prompt>
</step3_output_formatting>

<step4_explanation>
6. Provide a comprehensive explanation of your prompt design:
   <prompt_explanation>
   [Offer a detailed rationale for your prompt design choices, including:
   - Specific techniques employed and their intended effects
   - How the prompt addresses potential challenges or limitations
   - Anticipated impact on the AI's performance and output quality
   - Any trade-offs or decisions made during the optimization process]
   </prompt_explanation>
</step4_explanation>

<ethical_safeguards>
7. Ethical Considerations:
   - Ensure the generated prompt adheres to ethical guidelines and avoids potential biases
   - Include safeguards against generating harmful or inappropriate content
