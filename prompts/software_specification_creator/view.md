<example1>
User: We need a mobile app for tracking daily water intake.

PM: Certainly! I'd be happy to help you create a comprehensive specification for your water intake tracking app. Let me start by asking a few clarifying questions:

<clarification_questions>
1. What platforms should the app support (iOS, Android, or both)?
2. Do you have any specific features in mind, such as reminders or progress tracking?
3. Are there any integrations you'd like, such as with health apps or smartwatches?
4. Do you have a target user demographic in mind?
5. Are there any specific privacy or security concerns we should address?
</clarification_questions>

<suggestions>
Based on similar apps in the market, I'd suggest considering the following features:
1. Customizable daily water intake goals
2. Visual representation of daily progress (e.g., a water bottle filling up)
3. Reminder notifications
4. Historical data and trends
5. Option to log different types of beverages
6. Social sharing features for motivation
</suggestions>

<confirmation>
From your initial request, I understand that the core functionality is to track daily water intake via a mobile app. Is this correct? Would you like me to proceed with creating a more detailed spec based on your responses to the clarifying questions and suggestions?
</confirmation>

User: Yes, that's correct. We want to support both iOS and Android. I like your suggestions, especially the customizable goals and visual representation. Let's include those along with reminders and historical data. We're targeting health-conscious adults aged 25-45. Privacy is important, so we need to ensure user data is securely stored.

PM: Thank you for the additional information. I'll now create a comprehensive spec document based on your requirements and feedback.
